# Data_Cleaning

## Introduction
Data cleaning is a crucial step in any data science pipeline. Raw data often contains inconsistencies, missing values, duplicates, and errors that can significantly impact the accuracy and reliability of analytical models. This project aims to provide a robust and reproducible framework for cleaning diverse datasets.

## Features
Handling Missing Values: Strategies for imputing or removing missing data.

Duplicate Detection and Removal: Identifying and eliminating redundant entries.

Outlier Detection and Treatment: Methods to identify and manage anomalous data points.

Data Type Conversion: Ensuring correct data types for each column.

Format Standardization: Standardizing text, dates, and other categorical data.

Error Correction: Correcting common data entry errors or inconsistencies.

Scalability: Designed to handle moderately large datasets efficiently.
